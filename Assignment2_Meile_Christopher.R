# Assignment 2: Narcissistic Numbers

#* INFORMATION ABOUT WORKING DIRECTORY / GIT INFO GOES HERE. TBD

#* First, we will prompt the user to enter a three digit positive number. We
#* assign this to the variable 'user_value'. The prompt gives an indication
#* to the user of what kind of value we expect, but we will validate the input
#* later. For now, 'user_value' will be of type 'character' and can be anything.

user_value <- readline(prompt = "Please enter a three digit positive number: ")
